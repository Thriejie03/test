                 I like minimalist colors of nude and green because it represents being bold , peace and natural that embodies my personality . My life time work is being a reader, reading books mostly novels, fiction or nonfiction with the fun fact 500 plus books. I start reading books when Iâ€™m still in grade 3 and i started from bedtime story books to dark romance I&#39;m also a huge fan being a fangirl to huge k-pop wave like EXO and girls generation they are my youth and many reasons because they molds me to be me and i admire them greatly because of how dedicated and talented they are.
      <br/>
      I&#39;m more of a paradox than being attracted to sunrise or sunset. I am into the heavy purring rains, the cruel sound emits of the thunderstorm and the sharp blades of lightning. I&#39;m fond of the dark because I felt peaceful. I am also obsessed with dark themes like gothic, dark magic, witchcraft and myth ,additionally i like talking to random strangers foreign or local people&#39;s because I&#39;m fan of socializing and expressing ideas words them knowing their culture and adapting their culture
      <br/>
      I literally grow up in a strict household the religious family culture and isolation.
